## ML with HAR data

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

add description...

## Load and check data
```{r}
library(caret)
testing  <- read.csv("data/pml-testing.csv")
training <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv")
head(training)
dim(training)
```

## Feature selection

There are many dimensions so dimensionality reduction may be a strategy to apply. First let's see about near-zero covariates.
```{r}
nsv <- nearZeroVar(training, saveMetrics = TRUE)
nsv[nsv$nzv == TRUE, ]
```
We can exclude these covariates from the our data
```{r}
excludelist <- rownames(nsv[nsv$nzv == TRUE, ])
```



## Section


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
